# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest released version on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

- Report privately via GitHub Security Advisories (preferred): https://github.com/atniptw/fantastic-octo-waffle/security/advisories/new
- Alternatively, enable "Private vulnerability reporting" in the repository settings to show a "Report a vulnerability" button.

Include:
- A detailed description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant environment details (browser, OS)

We aim to acknowledge reports and investigate as time permits. Timelines or outcomes aren’t guaranteed. When appropriate, we may credit reporters in release notes.
