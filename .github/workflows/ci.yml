      # Note: Build step removed from Phase 0 CI workflow
      # Will be re-added once all entry points (index.html, etc.) are implemented
      # This ensures CI provides a real quality gate rather than passing with build failures

      # E2E tests (requires dev server to be running)
      # Note: These tests are currently placeholder tests and will be fully implemented in Phase 1
